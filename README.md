## **_A Introduction to Trivia/Quiz Games_**

     . Trivia/Quiz mobile games are one of the many genres of mobile app games.
       If we specifically talk about trivia games or quiz games, these are the
       types of games in which players answer interesting and fun questions about
       their topic of choice.

 

     . Furthermore, there is no limit to the types of topics that can be addressed 
       in a quiz or trivia game. Anything from movies, drama, sports to countries,
       cuisines, etc can be a potential topic for a trivia game.

 
     . Trivia games are more or less like quiz games that test your knowledge on different
       subjects. However, trivia games are much more fun and engaging than regular boring quizzes
